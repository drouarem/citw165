                        We chose Landon as the Project Manager because he is sort of the jack-of-all-trades when it comes to web development and he loves helping people out.
                        Landon had helped in pretty much every aspect of this site. It was clear to us that he should be the leader.

                <h2>Q: What is the purpose of your site?</h2>
                <h3>
                    A: Our theme is based around game reviews. The purpose of our site is to inform users about video games before he/she buys said game.
                    The site is to provide information about a game and give insight to our audience.
                </h3>

                <h2>Q: Who is your audience?</h2>
                <h3>A: Our target audience is directed towards gamers in general or people looking for written video game reviews. This audience�s age can range anywhere from early teens to mid-40�s. </h3>

                <h2>Q: What is the desired audience response?</h2>
                <h3>
                    A: Our desired audience response is to make the person feel more informed about the game they are planning to buy or to make them have an idea of what to expect in the game.
                    Some people just like reading written reviews.

            <h1>The Design of Our Site: Explained!</h1>
            <h3>
                <p>
                    We wanted "The Game Rocket" to have a simple and easy to use interface. Each content page is made up containing a written game review consisting of a few paragraphs, images, and/or videos.
                    In addition to the general site, we wanted our homepage to get right to the point and lure readers into our reviews. Our site has a basic black and white color scheme with colors used as an
                    accent on the side bar and each of our own content pages. We feel that most gaming sites are bogged up with ads and can be semi-difficult to navigate; The Game Rocket, on the other hand,
                    gets right to the point and lets our average user know what to expect.
                </p>
