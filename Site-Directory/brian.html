                <p>First off, I am big fan of the Marvel Universe and to find out they have games is just plus. 
                    Captain American started it all!! Captain America Shield Strike is designed to let you strike Hydra on his secret mountain base. 
                    They are planning their next strike and the fortress is heavily guarded by Hydra forces. 
                    Captain America shield strike loads rather quick and easily playable by almost any age group. 
                    The graphics life like and moving. The targeting system is easy to use and hit your target by following the pointing hand that aims the shield directly at its point of contention.
                    You accumulate points rather quickly but the precise kills you make gain more points. You can drag across enemies and hit them in sequence. 
                    If you are hit you will lose your health by visual health bar. You can press the space bar to raise your shield and defend yourself. 
                    If you hit the medical packs with your shield you will regain your health. 
                </p>

                <p>As mentioned, there are other games available that include matching, jewel align, connect the jewel, mosaic tile sort. 
                    This allows the user to change up what they are playing and still add to their money and goals.
                    In this game you can also interact with the game and other users. 
                    There are locations you can go and have objects order so that you can achieve additional goals.
                    You can also go and visit other players and help them and yourself by visiting. 
                </p>
                <p>TAKE OUT LATER: Brian said to use video, but there wasn't a youtube link or a video provided in the link within his review : http://disneyxd.disney.com/</p>
