                <h2>Q: Who is your audience?</h2>
                <h3>A: Our audience would be mostly targeted towards gamers in general or people looking for reviews on games before planning to buy said game.</h3>

                <h2>Q: What is the desired audience response?</h2>
                <h3>A: Our desired audience response is to make the person feel more informed about the game they are planning to buy or to make them have an idea of what to expect in the game.

            <h1>The Design of Our Site: Explained!</h1>
            <h3><p>
                We wanted our site to have a "minimalistic and clean" theme and vibe to it. We feel sites that are bogged down with ads, images, 
                and videos tend to distract gamers for the content he/she came for. Our site is simple to navigate around and find what you need. The name game "The Game Rocket" has a clean and simple logo,
                so we wanted our site to match that theme. The navigation of our site is easy enough for anyone to follow thanks to the hamburger popout nav-system; having a hamburger navigation tab
                really adds to the clean and simple look we are going for. It also makes this site relatively mobile friendly! As for use of graphics, we used those mainly for our reviews to show gameplay/screenshots of 
                what we are describing. Lastly, we included multimedia (YouTube videos) on the homepage to show the user who we are/what we talk about right from the get-go. When the user thinks, "The Game Rocket", we want them
                to think about game reviews.
