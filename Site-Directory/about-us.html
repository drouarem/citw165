                        He will be the one that keeps us on track with what still needs to be done.  He also will be helping with the graphics because of his experience designing and his knowledge of using Photoshop. </p></td>
                    <td><p>For the Usability Expert, we chose Tyler, because he currently has a job as a web developer and website usability plays a big role in his job. 
                        He also has a decent amount of knowledge working with forms. It makes the most sense to assign him the role as a Usability Expert.</p></td>

                <h2>Q: What is the purpose of your site?</h2>
                <h3>A: Our theme is based around game reviews. The purpose of our site is to inform users about video games before he/she buys said game.
                     The site is to provide information about a game and give insight to our audience. </h3>

                <h2>Q: Who is your audience?</h2>
                <h3>A: Our target audience is directed towards gamers in general or people looking for written video game reviews. This audience’s age can range anywhere from early teens to mid-40’s. </h3>

                <h2>Q: What is the desired audience response?</h2>
                <h3>A: Our desired audience response is to make the person feel more informed about the game they are planning to buy or to make them have an idea of what to expect in the game.
                    Some people just like reading written reviews.

            <h1>The Design of Our Site: Explained!</h1>
            <h3><p>
                We wanted "The Game Rocket" to have a simple and easy to use interface. Each content page is made up containing a written game review consisting of a few paragraphs, images, and/or videos.
                In addition to the general site, we wanted our homepage to get right to the point and lure readers into our reviews. Our site has a basic black and white color scheme with colors used as an
                accent on the side bar and each of our own content pages. We feel that most gaming sites are bogged up with ads and can be semi-difficult to navigate; The Game Rocket, on the other hand, 
                gets right to the point and lets our average user know what to expect.
            </p></h3>
